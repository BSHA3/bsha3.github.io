**Update 10-31-19:** Currently the original chain is 'stuck'! Satoshi's original difficulty adjustment algorithm was used, which only works out if the network gets a slow start. FPGA-tier power is now necessary to move this blockchain.

For this reason, the community created a hardfork at block 20418, **BSHA3-LWMA**.

### Forks

**BSHA3-LWMA:**

  - LWMA1 introduced at block 20418
  - No replay-protection
  - No `protocolversion` upgrade; uses same network as original BSHA3
